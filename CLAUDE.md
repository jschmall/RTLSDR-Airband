# CLAUDE.md

This file provides guidance to Claude Code (claude.ai/code) when working with code in this repository.

## This Is a Fork

This repo is a personal fork of [`rtl-airband/RTLSDR-Airband`](https://github.com/rtl-airband/RTLSDR-Airband).
Upstream is actively maintained; this fork tracks `main` and carries a small, deliberate delta.

Remotes to expect:

| Remote | Repo | Role |
|---|---|---|
| `origin` | `jschmall/RTLSDR-Airband` | This fork |
| `upstream` | `rtl-airband/RTLSDR-Airband` | Source of truth; rebase target |
| `yegors` | `yegors/RTLSDR-Airband` | Reference only — source of the cherry-picked file-output features |

**The value of this fork is that it stays close to upstream and remains easy to rebase.**
Keep the local delta small and well understood.

### Local changes carried on top of upstream

1. **`post_write_script` + `min_rx_seconds`** — cherry-picked from `yegors` commit `bb36bb0`
   ("Rework file output options"). Touches `src/config.cpp`, `src/output.cpp`, `src/rtl_airband.h`.
   Both options require `split_on_transmission = true`. `post_write_script` is used here to
   upload completed transmission files to RDIO via API.
2. **`sendto` byte-length fix** in `src/udp_stream.cpp` — `sendto()` was being passed a float
   *element* count where it needs a *byte* count. Corrected to `len * sizeof(float)`.

Anything outside those areas should match upstream. If a diff against `upstream/main` shows
changes elsewhere, treat it as unintended drift and flag it.

### Do not import from `yegors`

The `yegors` fork also contains SRT output support and its own UDP path. The UDP path there is
non-functional — its `O_UDP_STREAM` branch in `process_outputs()` checks squelch and then never
calls `udp_stream_write()`. Neither the SRT work nor that UDP code should be pulled in.

### Upstreaming

Bug fixes that are not personal preference — the `sendto` fix in particular — are candidates for
PRs to `rtl-airband/RTLSDR-Airband`. Open an issue describing the bug before sending a PR.
The `post_write_script` / `min_rx_seconds` features originated with `yegors`; credit accordingly
if they are ever proposed upstream.

## Working Norms

- **Keep this file updated** as changes are made to the codebase.
- **Never guess or make assumptions** — ask clarifying questions when requirements are unclear.
- **All code changes should include unit tests.** When possible, write tests first and implement code to make them pass (TDD).
- **After writing code, review comments** and remove any that don't explain non-obvious behavior — don't comment what the code already says.
- **This fork feeds live public-safety audio.** Changes here affect production Broadcastify feeds.
  Test on a low-priority SDR instance before rolling out.

## Development Environment

The repo is set up for development in VS Code using a devcontainer (`.devcontainer/`). When working
inside the devcontainer, all compile, test, and run commands must be executed inside the container.

Note: the devcontainer has failed to build under GitHub Codespaces (`docker buildx build` exits 1
during container creation). Local builds on Ubuntu without the devcontainer work fine — install the
dependencies directly and build with CMake as below.

## Wiki Documentation

User-facing documentation lives in a separate repo: https://github.com/rtl-airband/RTLSDR-Airband/wiki

Flag when code changes require wiki updates and provide suggested content — do not edit the wiki directly.

## Code Review Guidelines

When reviewing code:
- Reference specific files and line numbers (`src/foo.cpp:42`)
- Start with architecture-level concerns before line-level feedback
- Consider SDR/DSP domain context (signal processing constraints, real-time threading, buffer management)
- Verify the testing approach covers the behavior being changed
- Structure feedback clearly: separate blocking issues from suggestions
- Be pragmatic — prefer working correct code over theoretical perfection
- Check for consistency with surrounding code style and conventions

## Project Overview

RTLSDR-Airband is a C++ SDR (Software-Defined Radio) application that receives analog radio voice
channels from SDR devices (RTL-SDR, SoapySDR, MiriSDR) and produces MP3 audio streams for Icecast,
file recording, UDP, and PulseAudio.

## Build Commands

Dependencies: libconfig++, libmp3lame, libshout, libfftw3f, librtlsdr, libsoapysdr, libpulse.
Install via `.github/install_dependencies`.

```bash
# Standard debug build with unit tests
cmake -B builds/Debug -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Debug -DBUILD_UNITTESTS=TRUE
cmake --build builds/Debug -j4

# Release build with NFM and SoapySDR
cmake -B builds/Release -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Release -DNFM=TRUE -DSOAPYSDR=ON
cmake --build builds/Release -j4

# Run unit tests
./builds/Debug/src/unittests
./builds/Release/src/unittests

# Run the binary
./builds/Debug/src/rtl_airband -c /path/to/config.conf
./builds/Release/src/rtl_airband -c /path/to/config.conf
```

Key CMake flags (all in `src/CMakeLists.txt`):

| Flag | Default | Purpose |
|------|---------|---------|
| `NFM` | OFF | Enable Narrow FM demodulation |
| `PLATFORM` | `native` | Optimization target: `native`, `generic`, `rpiv2` |
| `RTLSDR` | ON | RTL-SDR driver |
| `MIRISDR` | ON | Mirics SDR driver |
| `SOAPYSDR` | ON | SoapySDR (vendor-neutral) driver |
| `PULSEAUDIO` | ON | PulseAudio output |
| `BUILD_UNITTESTS` | OFF | Build Google Test unit tests |
| `BCM_VC` | OFF | Broadcom VideoCore GPU FFT (RPi v2 only) |

The flag names are `NFM` and `PULSEAUDIO`, **not** `WITH_NFM` / `WITH_PULSEAUDIO`. A `-DWITH_NFM=ON`
typo silently defines an unused cache variable and leaves NFM off. Confirm from the build rather
than from the command line that was typed:

```bash
grep -n "NFM" builds/Release/CMakeCache.txt
```

### `NFM` matters for anything consuming the UDP stream

`WAVE_RATE` is 16000 when NFM is enabled and 8000 when it is not. Any downstream decoder of the raw
UDP PCM must match, or audio plays back at the wrong rate. This fork's deployed builds use `NFM` on.
A config containing `modulation = "nfm"` fails to parse on an AM-only build, which is a useful
implicit confirmation that the flag took effect.

## Code Formatting and Pre-commit

Uses clang-format v14 with Chromium style (indent=4, column limit=200, config in `.clang-format`).

```bash
# Install pre-commit hooks (once, after cloning)
pre-commit install

# Run all pre-commit hooks manually
pre-commit run --all-files

# Format C++ source files manually (also used by CI)
./scripts/reformat_code
```

Pre-commit hooks (`.pre-commit-config.yaml`) run on every commit and check:
- YAML/JSON validity, trailing whitespace, EOF newlines, shebang permissions, large files, merge conflict markers, private keys
- clang-format on all `src/*.cpp` and `src/*.h` files
- shellcheck on all bash scripts (excluding `init.d/`)
- black, isort, and pylint on all `system_tests/**/*.py` files
- Build (AM and NFM) and C++ unit tests when `src/*.cpp`, `src/*.h`, or `CMakeLists.txt` are modified (`scripts/run_unit_tests`)
- Python system tests when `src/*.cpp`, `src/*.h`, `CMakeLists.txt`, or `system_tests/` are modified (`scripts/run_system_tests`); only runs if the build/unit-test step passes

## CI and Pull Request Checks

Three workflows run on every PR (`.github/workflows/`):

**`code_formatting.yml`** — runs `./scripts/reformat_code` and fails if any files differ.

**`ci_build.yml`** — builds and tests four configurations on Ubuntu (x86 and ARM) and macOS:
```bash
cmake -B builds/Debug          -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Debug   -DBUILD_UNITTESTS=TRUE
cmake -B builds/Debug_nfm      -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Debug   -DNFM=TRUE -DBUILD_UNITTESTS=TRUE
cmake -B builds/Release        -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Release -DBUILD_UNITTESTS=TRUE
cmake -B builds/Release_nfm    -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Release -DNFM=TRUE -DBUILD_UNITTESTS=TRUE
```
Then runs `unittests` for all four, installs the Release+NFM build, and smoke-tests `rtl_airband -v`.

**`platform_build.yml`** — builds and tests an AM Release configuration (`PLATFORM=native`) on a Pi 4B runner and an `ubuntu-22.04-arm` runner, then runs unit tests and system tests. (Pi 3B runner is currently disabled.)

**Before submitting a PR**, the pre-commit hooks cover most checks automatically. For build system or config changes not touching `src/`, verify all four cmake configurations build cleanly by hand.

## System Tests

End-to-end tests live in `system_tests/`. They run the actual binary against generated IQ files and validate the audio output (MP3 duration, rawfile size). Managed with [uv](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/).

```bash
# Run system tests (requires Release binaries — run scripts/run_unit_tests first)
scripts/run_system_tests

# Run manually from the system_tests directory
cd system_tests
uv sync
uv run pytest tests/ \
    --binary ../builds/Release/src/rtl_airband \
    --nfm-binary ../builds/Release_nfm/src/rtl_airband \
    -v
```

Python tooling (formatter, import sorter, linter) is configured in `system_tests/pyproject.toml` under `[tool.black]`, `[tool.isort]`, and `[tool.pylint]`. Run them manually:

```bash
cd system_tests
uv run black .
uv run isort .
uv run pylint conftest.py helpers/ tests/
```

## Architecture

### Reception Pipeline

```
SDR device (input-*.cpp)
  → RX thread → circular sample buffer
  → demod thread: FFT (FFTW3) → demod (AM/NFM) → filter → CTCSS → squelch → AGC
  → channel output handlers
  → output thread: MP3 encode (lame) → Icecast / file / UDP / PulseAudio
```

### Key Source Files

| File | Purpose |
|------|---------|
| `src/rtl_airband.cpp` | Main entry point, demod loop, thread management |
| `src/rtl_airband.h` | All major struct/enum definitions (`device_t`, `channel_t`, `mixer_t`, `output_t`) |
| `src/config.cpp` | libconfig++ parsing for devices, channels, mixers, outputs |
| `src/output.cpp` | MP3 encoding, Icecast connections, file/UDP output |
| `src/udp_stream.cpp` | UDP socket setup and raw float PCM send |
| `src/mixer.cpp` | Multi-channel mixer with ampfactor/balance |
| `src/input-*.cpp` | SDR device drivers (rtlsdr, soapysdr, mirisdr, file) |
| `src/input-common.cpp/h` | Input device abstraction (`input_t` function-pointer interface) |
| `src/filters.cpp/h` | IIR lowpass and notch filters |
| `src/squelch.cpp/h` | Noise-power-based voice activity detection |
| `src/ctcss.cpp/h` | CTCSS tone detection |

### Adding or changing an output option

Three files, always:
1. The struct in `src/rtl_airband.h`
2. The parser in `parse_outputs()` in `src/config.cpp`
3. The per-tick dispatch in `process_outputs()` and the teardown in `disable_channel_outputs()`,
   both in `src/output.cpp`

Output types: `icecast`, `file`, `rawfile`, `udp_stream`, `mixer`, `pulse`.

### Device Modes

Each device operates in one of two modes, set via `mode = "multichannel"` (default) or `mode = "scan"` in config.

**`R_MULTICHANNEL`** — The SDR is tuned to a fixed center frequency and multiple channels are demodulated simultaneously from the same wideband capture. Each channel has a single `freq` value that must fall within the SDR's bandwidth. This is the common case for monitoring several frequencies at once.

**`R_SCAN`** — The device has exactly one channel, but that channel holds a `freqs` list of frequencies to cycle through. A controller thread monitors the squelch: after ~2 seconds of no signal (10 × 200 ms polls), it retunes the SDR hardware to the next frequency via `input_set_centerfreq()`. When a signal is detected, it stays on the current frequency. Per-frequency labels, squelch thresholds, modulation, notch filters, and CTCSS settings are all supported in the `freqs` list. (`rtl_airband.cpp:101-140`, `config.cpp:825`)

### Threading Model

- **RX thread** (1 per device, always) — reads SDR samples into the circular buffer (`input-common.cpp`)
- **Controller thread** (1 per device, `R_SCAN` mode only) — scanning/squelch state machine for devices that scan across frequencies; not created for `R_MULTICHANNEL` devices (`rtl_airband.cpp:1005-1013`)
- **Demod thread** (1 total by default; 1 per device if `multiple_demod_threads=true` in config) — FFT, demodulation, filter, CTCSS, squelch, AGC for all assigned devices (`rtl_airband.cpp:1044`)
- **Output thread** (1 total by default; 1 per device + 1 for mixers if `multiple_output_threads=true`) — MP3 encoding and streaming
- **Mixer thread** (1 total, only if any mixers are configured) — processes all mixers; not per-mixer (`rtl_airband.cpp:1091-1092`)

There is no wall-clock pacing anywhere in the audio production path — the only `SLEEP()` calls in
`rtl_airband.cpp` are connection retry and shutdown delays. Timing derives entirely from the SDR
sample rate driving the RX thread. Outputs with natural backpressure (lame encoding, disk writes,
Icecast) inherit that pacing implicitly; a bare `sendto()` does not. See the open issue below.

### Configuration Format

Config files use libconfig++ syntax. Sample configs in `config/`. Top-level sections:

```
devices: ( { type = "rtlsdr"; centerfreq = 120.0; gain = 25;
             channels: ( { freq = 119.5; modulation = "AM";
                           outputs: ( { type = "icecast"; ... } ); } ); } );
mixers: ( { name = "mix1"; inputs: ( { device=0; channel=0; ampfactor=1.0; } ); outputs: (...); } );
```

libconfig rejects an invalid boolean (`disable = ture;`) at parse time, but a misspelled or
misplaced *option name* is silently ignored. When a config change appears to have no effect, verify
the option name against `parse_outputs()` before assuming a code bug.

### Unit Tests

Tests use Google Test (fetched via CMake FetchContent). Test files in `src/test_*.cpp` cover filters, squelch, CTCSS, helper functions, and signal generation. `src/test_base_class.h` provides test utilities.

## Open Issue: UDP Stream Pacing

The `udp_stream` output produces valid 32-bit float LE PCM at `WAVE_RATE`, but delivery does not
appear to be paced to realtime. A downstream `ffmpeg -f null` read of the stream reported ~4x
realtime throughput, and every Liquidsoap consumption strategy tried so far — `input.ffmpeg`
directly on the UDP socket, the same wrapped in `buffer()`, with and without `self_sync`, and MP3
transcoded into `input.harbor` — produced choppy audio or a latency snowball ending in a broken
Icecast pipe.

**Root cause is not confirmed.** The unfinished diagnostic is inter-packet timing on the wire:

```bash
timeout 10 tcpdump -i eth0 -n -ttt udp port 9001 | head -40
```

- Tight bursts separated by gaps → the send side needs realtime pacing, and the fix belongs in
  `udp_stream_write()` or its caller in `process_outputs()`.
- Evenly spaced packets → the problem is downstream jitter or buffering, and nothing in this repo
  needs to change.

**Do not add pacing code before that measurement exists.** It is easy to write a plausible-looking
realtime send loop for a problem that may not be on the send side.

Note that `tcpdump -i any` did not capture this traffic on the deployment host; use the specific
interface.

## Deployment Context

- Builds happen on the `rtlsdr-airband` host (`10.0.50.31`), which also runs roughly a dozen
  concurrent `rtl_airband` instances — one per SDR, each with its own `~/rtl_<centerfreq>.conf`,
  invoked as `rtl_airband -FeQ -c <config>`.
- `sudo make install` places the binary at `/usr/local/bin/rtl_airband`, which is where the running
  units expect it. All instances pick up a new binary on their next restart; restart them one at a
  time and confirm each comes back clean.
- `rtl_airband -v` prints a git hash rather than a semantic version on this fork. That is expected —
  there are no release tags here.
- Audio consumers live on the `dsp` host (`10.0.50.30`) — Liquidsoap 2.4.0 (installed via opam)
  feeding Broadcastify. Same VLAN as the SDR host, direct L2, no firewall in the path.
- Per-instance channel configs live outside this repo and are not committed. Paste them into a
  session when they are relevant rather than adding them here.
