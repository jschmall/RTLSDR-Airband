## Adding or changing an output option

Three files, always:
1. The struct in `src/rtl_airband.h`
2. The parser in `parse_outputs()` in `src/config.cpp`
3. The per-tick dispatch in `process_outputs()` and the teardown in `disable_channel_outputs()`,
   both in `src/output.cpp`

## Device Modes

Each device operates in one of two modes, set via `mode = "multichannel"` (default) or `mode = "scan"` in config.

**`R_MULTICHANNEL`** — The SDR is tuned to a fixed center frequency and multiple channels are demodulated simultaneously from the same wideband capture. Each channel has a single `freq` value that must fall within the SDR's bandwidth. This is the common case for monitoring several frequencies at once.

**`R_SCAN`** — The device has exactly one channel, but that channel holds a `freqs` list of frequencies to cycle through. A controller thread monitors the squelch: after ~2 seconds of no signal (10 × 200 ms polls), it retunes the SDR hardware to the next frequency via `input_set_centerfreq()`. When a signal is detected, it stays on the current frequency. Per-frequency settings (labels, `squelch_threshold`/`squelch_snr_threshold`, `modulations`, `notch`/`notch_q`, `ctcss`, `bandwidth`, `ampfactor`) are **parallel lists** to `freqs` (same index = same frequency), not a list of objects — `freqs` is parsed as numbers. Only one channel per device in scan mode. (`rtl_airband.cpp:101-140`, `config.cpp:312-729`)

## Threading Model

- **RX thread** (1 per device, always) — reads SDR samples into the circular buffer (`input-common.cpp`)
- **Controller thread** (1 per device, `R_SCAN` mode only) — scanning/squelch state machine for devices that scan across frequencies; not created for `R_MULTICHANNEL` devices (`rtl_airband.cpp:1005-1013`)
- **Demod thread** (1 total by default; 1 per device if `multiple_demod_threads=true` in config) — FFT, demodulation, filter, CTCSS, squelch, AGC for all assigned devices (`rtl_airband.cpp:1044`)
- **Output thread** (1 total by default; 1 per device + 1 for mixers if `multiple_output_threads=true`) — MP3 encoding and streaming
- **Mixer thread** (1 total, only if any mixers are configured) — processes all mixers; not per-mixer (`rtl_airband.cpp:1091-1092`)

There is no wall-clock pacing anywhere in the audio production path — the only `SLEEP()` calls in
`rtl_airband.cpp` are connection retry and shutdown delays. Timing derives entirely from the SDR
sample rate driving the RX thread. Outputs with natural backpressure (lame encoding, disk writes,
Icecast) inherit that pacing implicitly; a bare `sendto()` does not. See "Resolved Issue: UDP Stream
"Pacing" Was a Byte-Length Bug" in the root `CLAUDE.md`.

## Configuration Format

Config files use libconfig++ syntax. Sample configs in `config/`. Top-level sections:

```
devices: ( { type = "rtlsdr"; centerfreq = 120.0; gain = 25;
             channels: ( { freq = 119.5; modulation = "AM";
                           outputs: ( { type = "icecast"; ... } ); } ); } );
mixers: { mix1: { outputs: ( { type = "icecast"; ... } ); } };
```

Mixers have **no `inputs` section** — a channel connects to a mixer implicitly via an output `type = "mixer"` + `name` (+ optional `ampfactor`, `balance`), see `mixer_connect_input` (`src/config.cpp`, `src/mixer.cpp`). A mixer block does accept the fork-only `reserve_inputs` (fork-delta item 29 in the root `CLAUDE.md`) and `remote_inputs` (item 42) keys.

Output types: `icecast`, `file`, `rawfile`, `udp_stream`, `mixer`, `mixer_remote` (fork-only), `pulse`.

libconfig rejects an invalid boolean (`disable = ture;`) at parse time, but a misspelled or
misplaced *option name* is silently ignored. When a config change appears to have no effect, verify
the option name against `parse_outputs()` before assuming a code bug.

`file`/`rawfile` outputs with `split_on_transmission = true` can set `split_include_transmission_start` (per output > global > default `false`; the global is parsed in `main()` in `src/rtl_airband.cpp`, the per-output value in `parse_split_file_times` in `src/config.cpp`). It changes only file names, never when files close. A transmission cut by `split_max_file_time` is named `<template>_<tx start>_<part start>[_<freq>]<suffix>`; part 1 repeats the tx start, and unsplit transmissions keep `<template>_<start>`. Names are built by `build_output_filename` (`src/output.cpp`). Part 1 is written under the standalone `.tmp` name and renamed to the part name in `close_if_necessary` when it is split; parts 2+ open under the part name, in the tx start's dated folder. A file that reaches max time while squelch is closed ends the transmission, as it always closed there. Examples: `config/split_include_transmission_start*.conf`.

`split_tx_drop_shorter_than` (seconds, global or per output, default `0` = off, must be `< split_max_file_time`) deletes the `.tmp` file instead of renaming it when a transmission that fit in one file spans (first to last write) less than the limit; every part of a split transmission is kept. The check is in `close_if_necessary` (`should_drop_split_tx`), so files closed at shutdown are never dropped. Drops are counted per channel frequency in the stats file as `channel_split_tx_dropped_counter`.
