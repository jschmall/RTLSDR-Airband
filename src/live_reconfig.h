// rate, resizes the input buffer, and recomputes every channel's bins/base_bins/dm_dphi, all
// synchronously within this device's own turn in the demod thread's round-robin (see
// demodulate(), rtl_airband.cpp) - the same single-writer-thread invariant device_apply_retune()
// already relies on. Also unlike retune/gain/bandwidth/correction, a failure here isn't free to

// device_apply_sample_rate() rolls back to the OLD rate (against the still-intact old buffer,
// never freed until the new rate is confirmed working) rather than leaving the device stopped.

// "all receivers failed" exit path with no new machinery needed there.
